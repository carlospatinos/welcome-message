        Here are a couple of things to keep in mind as we start:
        <ul>
          <li>
			    We will have students in the course on different schedules, with three different start dates. 
				I will post pacing information for each start date in the weekly announcements and your students 
				may need some guidance as to which they are to follow.
			</li>
            <li>
			    You will receive routine notification of your student's progress through the course from me and through 
				the Student Learning Portal. Please note this progress will be measured against the "typical" pacing for 
				the course and is intended not as a grade but as a guideline to check student progress.
			</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
