	<strong>Pacing:</strong> 
  In order to make sure everyone completes the course material in time for the AP exam I need to push everyone to be on the same schedule.
  This will ensure students complete all of the course content by week 16.  While I am serious about the deadlines I recognize some students will 
  start later so I will be a little flexible at the beginning of the semester.
