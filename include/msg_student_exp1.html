<div class="wl-section-label">What I expect of you in this course</div>
<ul>
	<li>I expect you to log in every weekday. Come to your online course at least as often as you come to your face-to-face classes.</li>
	<li>I expect you to effectively manage your time.  While the course is self-paced, I strongly suggest you follow the pacing guide very closely.</li>
	<li>I expect you to complete your own work and to contribute to the class discussions. You should be familiar with Michigan Virtual’s policies on plagiarism and follow them.</li>
	<li>I expect you to read the class <span class="wl-bblink">Announcements</span> every day.</li>
	<li>I expect you to check your course messages every day.</li>
</ul>
