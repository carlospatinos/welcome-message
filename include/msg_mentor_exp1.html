<div class="wl-section-label">What you can do to help your students</div>
<ul>
	<li>Take a look at the pacing guide under the <span class="wl-bblink">Course Info</span> section and compare it to your student's progress.</li>
	<li>Review your student's results on graded assignments and encourage them to reach out for help when they struggle.</li>
	<li>Encourage your student to use the additional resources suggested in many of the lessons. There are links to videos and tutorials and so forth that are quite useful.</li>
	<li>Keep an eye on the weekly announcements I post. These always include a reminder of the pacing a student should be following.</li>
	<li>Encourage your student to use the <span class="wl-bblink">Discussion Board</span> to get in touch with other students, to get help from a peer, and generally to hang out with classmates.</li>
</ul>
